This repository contains the results of two challenges proposed by Professor Giacomo Boracchi and Professor Matteo Matteucci during the course of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning [Politecnico di Milano, 2021/2022]. The goals of the two challenges were, respectively:
1) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification
2) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) for time series forecasting
